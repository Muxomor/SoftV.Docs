# Hypocrite

**Hypocrite.Services** and **Hypocrite.Fody** provide you very powerful services to make you app more cool :)   
The libraries are compatible with [Avalonia](https://www.avaloniaui.net/) and [WPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/desktop/wpf/introduction-to-wpf?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8). Almost everything is common in the libraries but there are still small differences in services. So for framework specific information go to the appropriate tab.  

Before we get stared you should know that the **Hypocrite.Services** is fully **dependent** on [Prism libraries](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) and [MVVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm) pattern.
